# HangManBrowserGame
If anyone of you love the classic Hangman game, well this one is for you. All you need is any  browser which can render javascript and you are good to go !
It is as simple as that. My game consists of a javascript function that generates random words and then uses these words to play Hangman with the user based upo the input provided by the use. Like the classic Paper-and-Pen version, here too a picture of a stickman on a noose about to die is rendered step by step for every wrong guess.
